# Project Repository: Bayesian and Multi-Objective Decision Support for Real-Time Cyber-Physical Incident Mitigation

This project repository provides resources and source code for performing Bayesian and multi-objective decision support for real-time cyber-physical incident mitigation. The BN structures capture probabilistic dependencies among CPS components, vulnerabilities, and hazards‚Äîenabling integrated assessment across cybersecurity, reliability, and safety dimensions.

The use of AutomationML, based on the CAEX (Computer Aided Engineering Exchange) schema, supports machine-readable and hierarchical representations of CPS assets and interdependencies. This facilitates model consistency, domain knowledge integration, and dynamic risk analysis.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

### `Reference Data Sheet.pdf`
Includes data and formulae used in the project.

### `AML_BN_CPS.py`
Performs BN-based CPS risk assessment on a generic AML model. Computes probabilities of failure and system-level impact. Tested on Python 3.12.8.

### `AML_BN_Stuxnet.py`  
Applies the risk modelling framework to the Stuxnet cyber attack scenario. Parses `Stuxnet.aml` and generates BN outputs.

### `AML_BN_BlackEnergy.py`  
Implements BN-based analysis on the BlackEnergy malware attack scenario using the corresponding AutomationML file.

### `AML_BN_SolarPV.py`  
Demonstrates the methodology in a Solar PV attack context. Based on ForeScout‚Äôs SUN:DOWN research:  
[https://www.forescout.com/research-labs/sun-down-a-dark-side-to-solar-energy-grids/](https://www.forescout.com/research-labs/sun-down-a-dark-side-to-solar-energy-grids/)

### `AML_BN_CBTC.py`  
Analyses a railway Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) attack scenario. Uses `RailwayCBTC.aml` to derive risk scores.

### `utils.py`  
Contains shared utility functions for AML file parsing and probability computation.
